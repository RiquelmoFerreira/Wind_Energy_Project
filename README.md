# About the Project

This project was done during the hands-on training of the Python for Data Analysis course carried out by Hashtag Programação.

The objective of the project was to analyze the efficiency of the turbines in relation to the theoretical value declared by the manufacturer and to analyze abnormalities defining an acceptable limit of variation, in this project the Python language and its libraries Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn were used in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
